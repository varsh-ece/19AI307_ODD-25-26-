# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## QUESTION:
Lovely is training to become a logic wizard. She enters a gate that tests her understanding of logical conditions.

She is given two magical conditions:

hasKey – whether she has the golden key (boolean)

knowsPassword – whether she knows the secret password (boolean)

The gate then evaluates her truthfulness using logical operators:

Write a program that:

Accepts two boolean inputs: hasKey and knowsPassword

Displays the results of:

hasKey && knowsPassword
hasKey || knowsPassword
!hasKey
!knowsPassword

**Input Format:**

First line: true or false (hasKey)

Second line: true or false (knowsPassword)

**Output Format:**

Access with AND: <true/false>

Access with OR: <true/false>

Does NOT have key: <true/false>

Does NOT know password: <true/false>

## AIM:
Aim:
To write a Java program that reads two integer numbers from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, and displays the results.

## ALGORITHM :

1.	Start
   
2.Create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

3.Read two boolean values i and j from the user.

4.Compute the following:
       l1 = i && j → Logical AND of i and j
   
       l2 = i || j → Logical OR of i and j
   
       l3 = !i → Logical NOT of i
   
       l4 = !j → Logical NOT of j
   
5.Display the results:

      "Access with AND: " + l1

      "Access with OR: " + l2

       "Does NOT have key: " + l3

      "Does NOT know password: " + l4

6. Stop

## PROGRAM:
 ```

```

## Sourcecode.java:
```
import java.util.*;
public class access
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        boolean haskey = sc.nextBoolean();
        boolean knowsPassword = sc.nextBoolean();
        System.out.println("Access with AND: " + (haskey && knowsPassword));
        System.out.println("Access with OR: " + (haskey || knowsPassword));
        System.out.println("Does NOT have key: " + (!haskey));
        System.out.println("Does NOT know password: " + (!knowsPassword));
    }
    
}
```

## RESULT:
The program has been executed successfully and the desired output has been obtained.
